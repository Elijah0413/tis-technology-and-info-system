- Reflection:
  > On Friday, 17 November 2023, first-year data engineering students had went to Petronas office (Menara ExxonMobil) and Huawei Customer Solution Innovation Centre (CSIC) in Kuala Lumpur for an industry visits. Through the visits in Petronas, we had widened our understanding about the productive mind of a software engineer and his crucial role in a company. Besides that, mentioned by the Head of software engineering and testing at PETRONAS Digital, Sir Roman Kvaska, we also learned that some skills like analytical skills and life-long learning is necessary to be mastered flawlessly to secure job in this competitive environment which technology kept advancing. While in Huawei, we were able to witness a cutting-edged technologies that beyond our curriculum. This had deepend our understanding about ICT and it's impacts to our daily life. Even though the visit was short and rushed, but we still able to learn many things fro the visits. Overall, the whole visits was great and memorable. I hope we can visits more industries similar to these visits in the future.
