- Reflection:
  > On Thursday, December 28, 2023, Credence (TM Subsidiary) orchestrated an illuminating industrial talk for UTM students, shedding light on the intricacies of system development and the journey within the analytics industry. The discourse not only delved into the technological landscape shaping the industry but also underscored the distinctive workplace culture at Credence, designed to cultivate a comfortable and collaborative atmosphere. Valuable career insights were imparted, offering students a roadmap for potential paths in the analytics domain. Additionally, the talk served as a wellspring of practical tips and motivation, emphasizing the significance of a continual eagerness to learn and the courage to step out of comfort zones. The encouragement to explore, not only in terms of technological advancements but also in building relationships with working partners, was a key takeaway, fostering a holistic understanding of the professional landscape and imparting essential wisdom for the students' future endeavors.
  > In conclusion, despite its brevity, the industrial talk proved to be a fount of valuable insights. The session provided a glimpse into the working environment at Credence, equipping us with a better understanding of the potential challenges and dynamics awaiting us in our future careers within the industry. Gratitude is extended to our lecturer, Dr. Aryati, and the event organizer, Miss Qistina, for facilitating this enriching experience.

Armed with this newfound knowledge, we are poised to apply these lessons in the industry post-graduation, carrying the wisdom gained into our future endeavors.
